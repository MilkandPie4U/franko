## What is Franko?
----------------
More than just a Crypto Currency. Franko is a new corporate model that promotes financial freedom and global unity for everyone. Non nobis solum, sed omnibus!

 - 30 second transaction times
 - coin creation halves in 22m blocks (~22 years)
 - ~11 million total coins
 - 0.25 coins created per block discovered
 - Dynamic difficulty adjusts every block

For more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of
the Franko client sofware, see http://www.frankos.org.

  - [Unix Build Notes](doc/build-unix.md)
  - [Windows Build Notes](doc/build-msw.md)

### FRK ports
RPC 7913
P2P 7912

### Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./franko-qt_test
